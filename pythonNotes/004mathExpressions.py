# Now that we know about variables and data types, let's look at some math
# expressions. The python interpreter can be used as a calculator to perform
# basic arithmetic. Type the expressions below - hit the enter key after each
# expression to get the result.

# Addition
1 + 2
3 + 9
5 + 7

# Subtraction
2019 - 1990
21 - 50

# Multiplication
2 * 3
4 * 5

# Division
1 / 3
5 / 2
10 / 5

# Exponentiation
2 ** 4
5 ** 3

# Combination of operations
2 * 3 + 5 - 10 * (5 + 3) + (2 ** 3)

# The results of expressions can be stored in variables. For example, the
# previous expression could be stored in a vatiable called result.
result = 2 * 3 + 5 - 10 * (5 + 3) + (2 ** 3)

# You can use variables in expressions as well. Notice that I didn't use the
# word "sum" for the result variable. That is because sum is a function that's
# built into python. We'll see what this means later.
num_1 = 1990
num_2 = 29
sum12 = num_1 + num_2
