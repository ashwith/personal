# Python has various data types depending on the kind of value stored. Many
# languages require you to explicitly tell the computer the data type. Python
# figures it out from context. Variables are created when you use them.

# ===============
#      Numbers
# ===============

# int
# ---
# The variables below store integers. This type is called an "int"
int_example_1 = 1
number_of_coins = 100

# float
# -----
# Float types store fractional numbers: 2.5, 1.3, etc
float_example_1 = 2.5
weight_of_chicken = 1.542

# ===============
#     String
# ===============
# Strings (called str) store characters, words, sentences. Strings are enclosed
# in either single or double quotes. The starting and ending quotes must match
# however
string_example_1 = "I am learning python"
ashwith_date_of_birth = 'March 03, 1988'

# ===============
#    Boolean
# ===============
# Boolean (called bool) types store either True or False. This can be the
# result of a comparison.
bool_example = True

# These are the basic data types. We'll look at more types next.
