# Python is a high-level general purpose programming language. It is also an
# interpreted language and not a compiled language. Compiled languages like
# C/C++ are first converted to machine code - a file containing code that a
# processor can understand. This code is stored in a binary executable file. If
# you've been used to Windows machines, such a file will normally have a .exe
# file extension.
# Python works differently. It uses a special program called an interpreter
# which reads each line of code and runs it. You can either type each line in
# an interactive session or you can write all of your code in a text file and
# have the interpreter run it. Even when the code is in a file, the interpreter
# will run each line one at a time. It won't convert your code to a binary
# file.
# We begin by looking at the first program we traditionally learn when learning
# a new language - the 'hello world' program. Its job is simple to display the
# phrase 'hello, world' (or some variant of it) on the screen. For python, the
# code is just one line:

print("hello, world")

# The code 'calls' a 'function' called 'print.' Functions are a sequence of
# python instructions grouped together to serve some purpose and given a name.
# In the present context, the function's name is 'print' and its purpose is to
# display stuff on the screen. In the present case, it displays the text inside
# the double quotes. Notice the parentheses surrounding the quotes. A function
# is always called by writing the name of the function (print in this case) and
# placing the arguments ("hello, world" in this case) in parentheses.
